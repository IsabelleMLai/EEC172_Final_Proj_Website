Our final project attempts to implement data from a temperature and humidity sensor to 
create a "smart" monitoring system that has the ability to display data in unique ways and 
alert users when data readings are in an unsafe range of values. Our project uses a temperature 
and humidity sensor to take readings, and displays a graph of the most recent 
readings on a Fahrenheit or Celsius scale on an OLED display that the user can 
control using a remote controller. The data will also be sent to Amazon Web 
Service to save all data. Our monitor will be able to determine when temperatures 
are dangerously high or low, and alert the user by sending an email to their 
personal email address. <br/><br/> Our source code can be
found <!-- replace this link -->

<h2>Video Demo</h2> 
<p>
  This demo video displays a slightly outdated version of our project. Here, our OLED display 
  and are UART terminal interface are working, but our most updated version of code
  also includes a display of the graphed temperature readings in the UART terminal, further 
  user interface debugging, and updated graphics on the OLED so that the initial graph does not
  contain "0" points.
</p>

<p>
  Our most updated code on 
  <a href="https://github.com/IsabelleMLai/EEC172_Final_Proj.git"> github</a> displays the updated changes. <br />

    The system for our project involves 4 main parts: communication 
    with the OLED, interrupts  with the IR receiver and the controller, 
    data being read from the temperature and humidity sensor, and communication
     with AWS. Besides the temperature sensor, code for each of the parts of 
     this project could be borrowed from previous labs and edited to interact
      cohesively. The OLED was used in lab 2 [1], the IR receiver was used in 
      lab 3 [2], and AWS was used in lab 4 [3]. The temperature and humidity 
      sensor offers C++ projects available on the internet that are compatible 
      with  Arduino that we could translate into C and edit to match the needs 
      of our CC3200 board. Documentation for the sensor shows that it uses a 
      unique communication signal to provide data.

    Our system works based on the following state diagram. The device will
    periodically monitor the temperature and the electrical conductivity
    (EC) of the solution and convert the values into a TDS value using a
    calibration curve. At the same time, the device will check for threshold
    inputs, both over the AWS shadow and via manual input on the IR
    receiver. It will compare the TDS with the lower and upper thresholds
    set by the user. If the value is within the thresholds, it will stay in
    the rest state. If the TDS is higher than the upper thresholds, it will
    go to the water state and activate the water pump until the PPM is lower
    than the upper thresholds and go back to the rest state. If the PPM is
    lower than the lower thresholds, it will go to the nutrient state and
    activate the nutrient pump until the PPM is higher than the lower
    thresholds and go back to the rest state. In each state, the device will
    periodically post the TDS.

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<!--h3 id="cc3200-launchxl-evaluation-board">CC3200-LAUNCHXL Evaluation
Board</h3-->
<p>We began implementing our project by using our project from lab 2 [1] 
  with the OLED as a base. We focus on controlling the OLED display's output 
  in the 'MasterMain()' function by using the Adafruit package to create images
   on the display. We implemented local functions to create displays for 
   Fahrenheit and Celsius graphs that include a title, and axis lines that 
   are located to include the most extreme temperatures recorded in history. 
   We use the 'drawChar()' and 'drawLine()' functions from the Adafruit package
    to display the title of each graph and the axis lines. We also created other
     local functions to help us plot points on the graph and update our graph.</p>

<p>
  Functions we defined to help us draw our graph: 
</p>
     <div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-evenly;">
      <div style='display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;'>
        
        <span class="caption">
          <ul style="text-align:left;">
          <li>void CreateTitle(char arr[], int arrsize) </li>
          <li>void MakePoint(int pointval, int nthpoint,
            char temp, int color)</li> 
          <li> void DisplayData(char temptype, int arr[],
            int addedv, int arrsize, int color)</li> 
          <li>void UpdateData(int newtemp, int arr[], 
            int arrsize) </li> 
          <li>void ConvertFCorCF(char prevtemp, char temp, 
            int arr[], int arrsize)</li> 
          <li>void DisplayGraph(char temptype)</li> 
          <li>void RedrawXAxis(char temp)</li> 
          <li>void RedrawYAxis(char temp)</li> 
          <li>int ConvertCharInt(char cStr[], int iStringLength) </li> 
        </ul>
        </span>
      </div>
      
    </div>
    


<p>The Fahrenheit graph has a range of temperatures from -126 to 136 degrees, 
  and the corresponding Celsius temperatures range from -88 to 58 degrees. The 
  two graphs have different x-axis locations relative to the y-axis to account 
  for the relative location of 0 degrees within the given scale's temperature 
  range, and we establish their absolute locations on the OLED screen as variables 
  to help us graph each point. Since the temperature ranges are different sizes, 
  we also define each pixel on the OLED to  represent different incremental values.
   To graph each temperature value, we use the Adafruit function 'fillCircle()' to 
   display a point on the graph, and use the pixel temperature increment value and 
   x-axis location to define the location of the point.  </p>

<p> 
  We use an int array to store the past ten temperature values we receive, 
  and use the function 'ConvertFCorCF()' to  convert all of the values in the 
  array between Celsuis and Fahrenheit. When a new temperature reading is available, 
  we use our function 'UpdateData()' to add the new temperature to the end of the array. 
  Our function 'DisplayData()' draws all of the data points in the array with a line 
  connecting each point. The x-axis of the graph represents time, so as a new temperature 
  is received, it is graphed at the right side of the graph, and all of the previous values
   are shifted to the left. Each time the data points are graphed, the x-axis is redrawn 
   for visual clarity, and the previous data points are drawn white to clear the graph quickly. 
   When more than 10 values have been graphed, the y-axis is redrawn for visual clarity. 
</p>

<p>
  We attempted to incorporate our code from lab 3 [2] into our project to be able 
  to use the controller to control the OLED display, but we ran into issues getting 
  the GPIO interrupt to work correctly, although we were able to incorporate the Systick 
  module into our project. We added code to define actions given a certain button press 
  on the controller, such as defining integer values for each of the numbered buttons on 
  the controller, but we were unable to test and implement the code into our project. 
</p>

<p>Functions we defined to determine button presses:</p>
<div style="display:flex;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-evenly;">
  <div style='display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;'>
    
    <span class="caption">
      <ul style="text-align:left;">
      <li>static int ButtonPressed(int bdata) </li>
      <li>void ConvertArrToFullNum(int arr[], int asize)</li> 
      <li> void button-flag-raised(volatile unsigned 
        char* SW2intflag, uint64t deltaus)</li> 
      </ul>
    </span>
  </div>
  
</div>

<p>
  We were also unable to get the temperature sensor's code to run, 
  so in place of these two challenges, we implemented a UART interface for the 
  OLED display. We used the 'uart-demo' project code to help us take in user inputs
   from the terminal and placed the bulk of the code in a while loop in our 
   project's 'MasterMain()' function. We designed our interface to alternate between 
   asking the user for a temperature scale, Celsius or Fahrenheit, and asking the user 
   for a temperature value in given bounds for the scale. When the user types in an 
   invalid value, the same prompt is asked again. To make the UART interface compatible 
   with our project, we convert the user input from a character array to and int array. 
   After each prompt, the OLED updates to display each new piece of information. The title 
   and axes are displayed after the temperature scale is inputted, and a plot of the past 
   ten readings including the newest data value is graphed when the user enters a value. 
   After the user enters a valid data point, the past ten readings are displayed in the most 
   recent temperature scale form on the UART terminal. 
</p>

<p>
  We did not successfully incorporate AWS into our project. 
</p>

<p>
  Our hardware for this project consisted of the OLED pin configuration and the 
  IR receiver circuit combined. A schematic is shown in the photo below:

</div>



<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p> 
  We faced challenges in getting our previous projects to run correctly, 
  which made it hard for us to utilize that code for our final project. 
  Specifically in implementing the IR receiver into our OLED project, we faced 
  issues with getting the GPIO interrupt to work correctly. We tried running our
  project on different micro controllers, and changing the pin taking in the IR 
  receiver's signal, but we were unable to resolve the issue. We used the Saleae 
  logic analyzer and found that the IR receiver circuitry was working, but that our
   micro controller was unable to pick up the signal and never raised an interrupt 
   in our main function. We chose to use the UART as our user interface since we were 
   unable to get the controller or the sensor to run. 
</p>

<p> We also faced challenges including AWS into our project due to a time constraint. 
  We could have focused more time on incorporating AWS into our project over attempting
   to debug the IR receiver. </p>


<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>In the future we would like to get the temperature sensor to work, and to 
  successfully  implement the controller and IR receiver to allow control over 
  the OLED display rather than relying on the UART interface for information. We 
  would also like to have the data stored in AWS. The efficiency of our display 
  is relatively good as the display graphs new data points quickly, but we could 
  improve the  time it takes to change the graph when the temperature scale changes. 
  We could do this by only redrawing the x-axis and changing the title. We would 
  also like to incorporate humidity graphs and data into our project in the future. </p>
